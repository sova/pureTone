# pureTone
pureTone is a screen-based instrument that functions as a drone and tone generator. Learn harmonic relationships with a visual plot of the oscillations and hear the relationships live!

# screens

There is one main screen, tap to create a new oscillator, slide the newly created rectangle around to adjust the frequency (in Hertz) and volume.

# types of waves

Currently, all tones played are using the same waveTable and therefore sound like sine waves or square waves, depending on version.  Future work includes allowing users to change the wavetype on the fly.
